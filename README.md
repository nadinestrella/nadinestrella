## My projects 💻

* **[Harry Potter](https://nadinestrella.github.io/HarryPotter/)🧙🧙**

  The project consists of a web search engine for characters from the famous Harry Potter saga 🧙 🧙 🧙, where you can find a wealth of information.
There are three types of filters:
-By character
-By House
-By Gender
Additionally, there is a reset button to return the page to its initial state.
You can also view the details of each character by clicking on their card.

  An interactive web application designed to make gift-giving occasions a breeze for parents and a world of fun for kids.
